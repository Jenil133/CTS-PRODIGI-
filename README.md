<p>
Connected experiences for consumers
How do you ensure that consumers are loyal to brands and will not switch between brands? Brenda is a retail store assistant, working for a large cosmetics retailer. She has been noticing that many
of her loyal customers who would buy a certain shade of lipstick or eye shadow have been switching to a rival brand which makes similar shades at a lower price. However, she realizes that her brand has much betterquality products, and would like to provide attractive offers to her customers to retain them. She would like to have solutions for: 
• Digitizing the buying cycle of the consumer through D2C (Direct-to-Consumer) 
• Hyper-personalizing consumer experience using insights into individual preferences 
• Digital marketing campaigns and loyalty programs
